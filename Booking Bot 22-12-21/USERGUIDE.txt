SETUP
1. Check your Chrome version by clicking the 3 dots at the top right in Chrome, Help, then About Google Chrome. â„¢Download the appropriate web driver for Chrome from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.
    1.1 Move the chromedriver.exe file to the same folder as this one.
2. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download Python (if you do not have Python installed yet).
3. Go to the folder that contains the program files.
    2.1 Mac: Follow the instructions on https://www.maketecheasier.com/launch-terminal-current-folder-mac/ to open Terminal
    2.2 Windows: Type 'cmd' on the address bar of the Windows Explorer window of the current folder.
4. In Terminal (Mac) or CMD (Windows), type 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
    4.1 For Windows, you might need to type 'py -m pip install -r requirements.txt' instead.

USAGE
1. Follow Step 3 of SETUP to open CMD or Terminal in the current folder.
2. Type 'python3 RUNME.py' or 'py RUNME.py' and follow the instructions to add a new booking. (Use Ctrl+Z to exit the program any time)
3. Before the time of the booking, click 3. in RUNME.py to check that the details of the upcoming booking are correct. Keep the program running until the time of the booking!
4. Make sure your PC is switched on (set it to not sleep or hibernate!) at the time of the booking.
5. Check if the booking has been made when you are free

THINGS TO NOTE
1. For more competitive slots (e.g. Stadium Field), add those bookings first so that they will be booked first.
2. Currently unable to select options in the subvenue dropdown list :(
3. If CAPTCHA appears, this program will also unfortunately fail :(


Possible things that might screw it up:
1. if only some of the slots are available (not all slots could be added to cart), will there be a 'added to cart' message still?
